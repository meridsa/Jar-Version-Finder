# Jar-Version-Finder
Ant builds do not use version numbers, Maven does. Going from Ant to Maven can be made a hassle by trying to find the versions old jars have used.
Uses a bash script to find jars and their checksums and compares them to https://repository.sonatype.org/ with a python script, saves data like
# JAR NAME,     GROUPID,        ARTIFACTID,     VERSION,        DATE UPLOADED,  CHECKSUM
# jarname1,     com.comp,       thingy,         2.3,            21-11-12,       checksum1
# jarname2,     notFound,       notFound,       notFound,       notFound,       checksum2
# jarname3,     org.organ,      dongy,          1.4.1,          04-01-16,       checksum3
# etc
